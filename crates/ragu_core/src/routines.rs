//! Functions that take [gadgets](crate::gadgets) as input and produce gadgets
//! as output.
//!
//! Routines are intended for portions of the circuit that are either invoked
//! multiple times (and so drivers can memoize their synthesis) or have
//! efficiently predictable outputs (and so drivers can parallelize their
//! synthesis).
//!
//! Routines are reusable circuit components identified by [`RoutineId`], which wraps
//! [`TypeId`]. Different type parameters yield different identities (e.g., `Evaluate<R<10>>`
//! and `Evaluate<R<13>>` are distinct routines).
//!
//! Routines must be **fungible by type**: all instances of a concrete routine type produce
//! identical constraints. Encode constraint-affecting parameters as type parameters, not
//! runtime fields.
//!
//! [`RoutineShape`] describes resource consumption (multiplication gates, linear constraints)
//! for floor planning. [`RoutineRegistry`] tracks invocations during circuit discovery,
//! mapping each [`RoutineId`] to its [`RoutineInfo`] entries for structural analysis.
//!
//! ## Design Decisions
//!
//! - **Type-based identity**: [`RoutineId`] uses [`TypeId`] because routines are fungible
//!   by type. [`TypeId`] is known before synthesis, whereas a constraint hash would require
//!   synthesizing first.
//!
//! - **G/H polynomial split**: Routines have internal (G) and external (H) polynomial
//!   parts. G depends on routine structure and is cacheable, whereas H depends on witness
//!   values and varies per proof.
//!
//! - **Discovery vs. synthesis**: [`RoutineRegistry`] captures structural information
//!   during discovery (via [`Emulator::counter`](crate::drivers::emulator::Emulator::counter)).
//!   Memoization eligibility (input patterns) is determined at synthesis time.

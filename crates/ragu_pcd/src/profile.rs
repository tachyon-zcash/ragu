//! Proof profiles.
//!
//! A profile is the set of internal circuits a proof carries beyond the
//! fuse's own, and so the shape of the proof: how many polynomials it holds
//! and how long the two endoscaling walks over them run. Every proof an
//! application makes has its profile's shape, and a proof is verified against
//! the registry it was made for, so the profile is fixed per application.
//!
//! Two profiles are foreseen. Wallets prove in [`Standard`]: the fuse alone,
//! compressed to a few kilobytes and sent over the network. Aggregators prove
//! in [`Aggregator`]: the fuse plus the circuits that verify a standard
//! compressed proof in circuit. A wallet's proof then enters an aggregator's
//! fuse as witness data rather than as a child, so the two shapes never have
//! to agree, and only the aggregator's proofs carry the extra polynomials.
//! The aggregator's circuits verify proofs of the standard profile, so the
//! aggregator depends on it; the standard profile knows nothing of the
//! aggregator.
//!
//! A cycle names its profile through [`ProfiledCycle`], so every generic item
//! in this crate reaches the shape through the cycle it already carries, and
//! a wallet proof and an aggregator proof over the same curves are different
//! types. [`Pasta`] proves in the standard profile; [`Profiled`] puts a cycle
//! under any other profile, keeping its curves, generators and Poseidon
//! instances. The native and nested internal modules size their walks, index
//! lists and value containers from the profile's [`Shape`], so one binary
//! holds every profile's layout. The standard profile's layout is also the
//! internal modules' constant one, pinned to its shape at compile time.

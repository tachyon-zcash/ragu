## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added recursion profiles through `profile::{Profile, ProfiledCycle, Profiled,
  Standard, Aggregator, Shape}`. Profiles declare internal extension circuits,
  stages, statement and cross-cycle bindings, and endoscaling work.
- Added `ApplicationBuilder::finalize_with` and `Application::context` for
  profile-specific prover context. The extension API is experimental while
  decompression is integrated; the built-in profiles currently add no extensions.
- Added optional `baked-aggregator` parameters through
  `pasta::baked_aggregator()` for `R<14>` extension tests. Standard's `baked()`
  keeps its original `R<13>` table sizes and generators, including when the
  additional Aggregator parameters are enabled and loaded. The production
  Aggregator rank remains to be fixed with its decompression circuits.
- Added sealed, static computational-backend selection between Ragu's reference
  and accelerated implementations, defaulting to
  `ragu_backend::ReferenceBackend`.
- Added `SelectableBackend::Verifier`, the backend whose kernels
  `Application::verify` consults, and support for
  `ragu_acceleration::AcceleratedProver`, which accelerates proving while
  verifying with the reference kernels.
- Added `Application::verify_differential` under `test-utils`: checks a proof
  with both verifiers and asserts they agree, returning the uncompressed
  verdict. The adversarial test suites and the fuzz harness check every proof
  with both verifiers.

### Changed

- `ApplicationBuilder`, `Application`, and their proving, verification and
  compression methods now require `ProfiledCycle` rather than only `Cycle`.
  Custom cycles must select a profile; Pasta's implementation requires `baked`.
- Ordinary verification rejects malformed proof shapes before traversal.
  Compression returns `Error::InvalidWitness` for malformed shapes, and so do
  `Application::fuse` and `Application::rerandomize` for a child proof of
  another shape.
- Ordinary verification returns rejection for identity commitments used by
  claim targets or the bridge transcript, instead of an input error, while
  preserving application header-encoding errors.
- `Profile::check`, which finalization runs, refuses an empty profile name and
  a built-in profile's name on any other profile. `Extension::is_consistent`
  requires each circuit's stage list to be strictly increasing, so that the
  stage whose final mask covers the circuit is the last it loads.
- Profile validation rejects zero endoscaling counts and counts whose product
  is at most four, which cannot produce convergent walk sizes. Binding
  documentation now makes declaration/circuit agreement a setup obligation
  rather than claiming a mismatch always rejects.
- `ApplicationBuilder::finalize` derives both registry tags from the registered
  circuits; there is no tag to supply. Proofs made under externally supplied
  tags do not verify.
- Fuse batches independent registry commitments and challenge binding partials
  through the selected backend. Its two error-term layers and child rx
  evaluations use ordered backend iteration, with a lazy serial default.
- Compressed verification batches the independent MSMs for its three derived
  fold commitments on each curve and its two recomputed nested stages through
  the selected verifier backend. Compression shares the fold-commitment batch.
- Arithmetic and MSMs now use Udon from Zakura Common; the `native-msm`
  feature is no longer needed.
- Baked Pasta parameters are loaded through `ragu_pcd::pasta::baked`.

- Replaced the placeholder PCD transcript tag with `ragu-pcd-v1`. Proofs produced
  with the previous `FIXME` tag are incompatible with this protocol version.
- The `std` feature now enables the required `alloc` feature.
- Routed sparse polynomial evaluation, reverse-dot computations, registry
  evaluation, and polynomial commitments through the selected backend across
  proving and verification paths.
- `Application::verify` computes its acceptance kernels through the sealed
  `SelectableBackend::Verifier` of the selected backend rather than through
  the selected backend directly.
- `Application::verify`, the uncompressed verifier, is renamed to
  `Application::verify_uncompressed` and is now a test oracle behind the new
  `test-utils` feature, which `unstable-fuzzing` enables. Production
  verification compresses a proof with `Application::compress` and checks it
  with `Application::verify_compressed`.

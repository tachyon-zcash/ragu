# Usage

## Dependencies and Requirements

* The minimum supported [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) version is currently **1.85.0**.
* Ragu requires minimal dependencies and currently strives to avoid using dependencies that are not already used in [Zebra](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra).
* Ragu does not require usage of the standard library in code that is compiled for the target architecture.
